Thank you for using our Pilot Awards module.

There are two different module versions based on your phpvms version.
If your phpVMS version is <= 1.936 then use the files which are inside the tpl folder.
Otherwise, you will have to use the files which are inside the php folder.

Check the module manual for more information.
